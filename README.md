This is a repo of scripts that I use for the underlying replayOS operating system Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm. 


**XBOX Dongle and controller support script**

xone is needed to use the microsoft wireless dongle, and also has better sleep/wakeup support than xpad.

just run this one liner in replayOS ssh and then you can have a more robust xbox controller support installer.

```
wget -qO- https://github.com/forkymcforkface/CRT-Custom/archive/refs/heads/main.zip | busybox unzip -qd /opt/xbox-drv - && cp -r /opt/xbox-drv/CRT-Custom-main/replay/controllers/* /opt/xbox-drv/ && rm -rf /opt/xbox-drv/CRT-Custom-main && chmod -R +x /opt/xbox-drv
```

**HDMI Audio script**

Some HDMI DACs with built-in AUX ports fail to output audio through the AUX jack. I found a workaround that uses an EDID file from a known working DAC. This does not affect video output and is easy to install via SSH. Currently, it only applies to the primary HDMI port and hasnâ€™t been tested with display cloning in replayOS. If this doesn't resolve your HDMI audio issue, consider switching to a DAC known to work.

- SSH into ReplayOS with root/replayos credentials. How to ssh into ReplayOS is on the replayOS Wiki.
